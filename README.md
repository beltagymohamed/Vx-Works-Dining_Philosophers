# Vx-Works-Dining_Philosophers
Beltagy

Implementation of an application that simulates the famous "Dining Philosophers" problem shown in Figure 1: In this example,
five philosophers sit around a table. In front of each philosopher is a plate with spaghetti.
To the left and right of the plate is one fork. In order to eat, a philosopher needs to use
two forks (the one to the left and the one to the right). Philosophers mostly think but at
certain times they get hungry and want to eat.

Please see the Dining-Philosophers.pdf for full description
Thanks
